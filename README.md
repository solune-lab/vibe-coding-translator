## ⚡ The Problem: "Development Constipation"
When you tell an AI to "make this look better" or "fix the layout," it often:
1.  **Guesses blindly**, leading to unintended side effects.
2.  **Over-engineers** simple components into complex spaghetti code.
3.  **Vanishes your quota**—Endless, unguided revisions can burn through your token budget in minutes.

`Vibe Coding Translator` is the precision engine designed to eliminate this ambiguity and **stop the token burn**.

## 🚀 How it Works
This tool acts as a **Communication Bridge**. It translates your messy thoughts into industrial-grade AI instructions with:
* **Scope Locking**: Ensures the AI only modifies what you intended, preventing expensive "logic drifts."
* **Surgical Precision**: Built-in coordinate offsets and specific UI logic.
* **Token Efficiency**: By providing a rigid "Ground Truth," you eliminate redundant model calls and "hallucination loops."
* **Zero Misunderstanding**: Formats requirements into a language that Agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) cannot ignore.

## 📦 Part of The Vibe Stack
This project is a core component of [The Vibe Stack](https://github.com/solune-lab/the-vibe-stack) — a production-ready survival kit for frugal developers.

## 🛠️ Usage
1.  Access the tool: [soluneai.com/vibe-coding-translator](https://soluneai.com/vibe-coding-translator/)
2.  Input your "Vibe" (e.g., *"Make the header more modern and fix the mobile padding"*).
3.  Get the **Agent-Ready Prompt** — a structured instruction optimized for AI Agents.
4.  Paste it into your Agent and **save your tokens** by getting it right the first time.
