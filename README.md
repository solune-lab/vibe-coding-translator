**Stop AI Agents from Over-Engineering. Convert natural language into structured, precise specifications.**

## ⚡ The Problem: "Development Constipation"
When you tell an AI to "make this look better" or "fix the layout," it often:
1.  **Guesses blindly**, leading to unintended side effects.
2.  **Over-engineers** simple components into complex spaghetti code.
3.  **Vanishes your quota** in less than 30 minutes due to endless revisions.

`Vibe to Spec` is the precision engine designed to eliminate this ambiguity.

## 🚀 How it Works
This tool acts as a **Communication Bridge**. It translates your messy thoughts into industrial-grade AI instructions with:
* **Scope Locking**: Ensures the AI only modifies what you intended.
* **Surgical Precision**: Built-in coordinate offsets and specific UI logic.
* **Zero Misunderstanding**: Formats requirements into a language that Agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) cannot ignore.

## 📦 Part of The Vibe Stack
This project is a core component of [The Vibe Stack](https://github.com/solune-lab/the-vibe-stack) — a production-ready survival kit for frugal developers.

* **Mouth**: **Vibe to Spec** (You are here)

## 🛠️ Usage
1.  Access the tool: [soluneai.com/vibe-to-spec](https://soluneai.com/vibe-to-spec)
2.  Input your "Vibe" (e.g., *"Make the header more modern and fix the mobile padding"*).
3.  Get the "Spec" — a structured prompt optimized for AI Agents.
4.  Paste it into your Agent and watch it execute with 100% accuracy.
